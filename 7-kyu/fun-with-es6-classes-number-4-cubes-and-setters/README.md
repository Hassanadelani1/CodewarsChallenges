The way we achieved this in our code was by the use of <strong>getters</strong> which automatically computed the volume and surface area of the cuboid whenever either one of <code>length, width, height</code> changed.  However, in the previouos exercise, one thing we could not do is define <strong>setters</strong> for surface area or volume of a cuboid because for a given volume/SA, there were an infinite number of possibilities to the dimensions of the cuboid.</p><p>However, for cubes (a special type of cuboid), since their <code>length</code>, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are always the same, it is possible to figure out the side length of a cube given its surface area and/or volume.  Therefore, in this Kata, you will be asked to define <strong>setters</strong> as well as getters for both the surface area and volume of a cube.</p><h2 id="task">Task</h2><p>Define a <code>class Cube</code> whose constructor function takes exactly one parameter <code>length</code> and stores the value of the argument into <code>this.length</code>.  You will then define <strong>both a getter and a setter</strong> for the <code>surfaceArea</code> and <code>volume</code> of the cube.</p><p>No initial code will be given.
